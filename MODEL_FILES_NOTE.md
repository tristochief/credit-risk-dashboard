# Model Files Note

The following model files are required but too large for direct GitHub upload:
- lr_model.pkl
- rf_model.pkl
- xgb_model.pkl
- scaler.pkl
- credit_default_data.xls

These files need to be uploaded separately or stored in a cloud storage service.

To regenerate these files, run the model training scripts in the notebooks/ directory.
